# jira-resizer
Chrome extension to make the issue panel in a Jira backlog larger

## Installing
* Go to `chrome://extensions/`
* Enable `Developer mode`
* Click `Load unpacked`
* Select the dir containing the extension
* Improve your Jira experience

## Using
* Open your backlog in Jira
* Select an issue
* Click the extension button
* Revel in your new efficient, full screen, Jira life
  * Note that whenever you select a new issue, you'll have to trigger the extension again

### Changing the width of the panel
* The width is tailored for my 24" monitor and hardcoded because I'm lazy. Change it in [resizeJira.js](resizeJira.js)
